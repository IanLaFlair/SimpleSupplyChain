## Some Lib

Library:

- truffle-assertions - Used this to originally get the events to fire, don't think it is needed because I found a code snipped to raise the events.
- truffle/hdwallet-provider - HD Wallet-enabled Web3 provider. Use it to sign transactions for addresses derived from a 12 or 24 word mnemonic.
